# Fellowz Chat App - Fixes and Improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Fixed

### 1. Google Sign-in Redirect Issue âœ…
**Problem**: Users were not being redirected properly after successful Google authentication, causing the signup page to reload instead of closing.

- Added proper redirect result handling with page reload to ensure state updates
- Removed popup fallback that was causing issues in incognito/other browsers

**Problem**: Firebase configuration issues and missing environment variables.
